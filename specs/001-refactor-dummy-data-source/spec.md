# Feature Specification: Refactor Dummy Data Source

**Feature Branch**: `001-refactor-dummy-data-source`  
**Created**: Tuesday, October 21, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "this project is a mess. i want you to refactor it by following the best practice and rewrite the dummy data source"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Improved Code Maintainability (Priority: P1)

As a developer working on the project, I want a well-structured codebase with a proper data source implementation so that I can maintain and extend the application efficiently without dealing with technical debt.

**Why this priority**: A clean, maintainable codebase is critical for the long-term success of the project. The current "mess" makes it difficult to add features, fix bugs, and onboard new developers.

**Independent Test**: The refactored data source can be fully tested by verifying that all existing functionality continues to work as expected while the code is now organized following established best practices, making it easier to understand and modify.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer needs to access dummy data, **When** they call the refactored data source methods, **Then** they can retrieve data reliably with clean, documented interfaces
2. **Given** the application needs to load dummy data, **When** the application runs, **Then** the data loads from the properly structured data source without errors

---

### User Story 2 - Consistent Data Access Patterns (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I want consistent data access patterns across the application so that I can easily understand and work with the data layer without dealing with inconsistent or duplicated logic.

**Why this priority**: Consistency reduces cognitive load and minimizes bugs related to data access discrepancies.

**Independent Test**: The rewritten data source provides a single, consistent interface that can be used throughout the application, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a component needs to fetch data, **When** it calls the standardized data source methods, **Then** it receives consistent responses regardless of which part of the application requests the data

---

### User Story 3 - Separation of Data Concerns (Priority: P3)

As a developer, I want clear separation between data source logic and presentation logic so that I can modify data access without affecting UI components.

**Why this priority**: Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns is a fundamental best practice that makes the codebase more maintainable and testable.

**Independent Test**: Changes to the data source implementation do not require corresponding UI changes, and vice versa.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the data source implementation needs to be modified, **When** changes are made to the data layer, **Then** UI components continue to function without modification

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the dummy data source encounters malformed data?
- How does the system handle missing or incomplete data entries?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a well-structured data access layer that follows established best practices
- **FR-002**: System MUST replace the current "messy" dummy data implementation with a clean, maintainable implementation
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide consistent interfaces for accessing dummy data throughout the application
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing code that depends on the data source
- **FR-005**: System MUST follow clean code principles and design patterns appropriate for the codebase
- **FR-006**: System MUST include proper error handling and validation for dummy data operations

### Key Entities

- **Dummy Data Source**: Represents the service/component that provides test data to the application, abstracting the implementation details of how dummy data is stored and retrieved
- **Data Access Interface**: Defines the standardized methods available for other components to request and manipulate dummy data

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Developers spend 50% less time understanding and modifying data-related code after refactoring
- **SC-002**: The refactored codebase maintains 100% functionality with all existing features working as before
- **SC-003**: Code quality metrics (maintainability, complexity, etc.) improve significantly
- **SC-004**: Onboarding time for new developers reduces by at least 30% due to improved code clarity
