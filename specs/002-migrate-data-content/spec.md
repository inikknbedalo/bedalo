# Feature Specification: Migrate Data Content to Astro Collections

**Feature Branch**: `002-migrate-data-content`  
**Created**: Tuesday, October 21, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "this project is kinda messy and inconsistent. this might be a problem for future development. for example, the data is separated across json and md files where its not the best practice. i want to fix it by implementing best practice of the framework used."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Standardize Data Management (Priority: P1)

As a developer working on the Bedalo3 website, I want to consolidate data management using Astro's content collections so that all content is managed in a consistent, type-safe manner following framework best practices.

**Why this priority**: This is critical because the current inconsistent data management is causing maintenance issues and making future development more difficult. Standardizing on Astro's content collections will improve developer experience and reduce errors.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that content from existing JSON and MD files is properly migrated to Astro content collections, and that all website functionality continues to work as expected.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the existing mix of JSON and MD files for content, **When** I run the build process, **Then** all content is properly loaded through Astro content collections with proper type definitions
2. **Given** a new content item needs to be added, **When** I create it using the content collection API, **Then** it properly appears on the website with correct styling and formatting

### User Story 2 - Maintain Content Integrity (Priority: P2)

As a content manager for Dusun Bedalo, I want the migrated content to maintain all existing functionality so that there are no visible changes to the website for end users.

**Why this priority**: It's important to ensure no disruption to the public website during the migration of internal data structures.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by comparing the website before and after migration to ensure all content displays correctly with no missing information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the website with existing content in JSON and MD files, **When** content is migrated to Astro collections, **Then** all pages display the same content without loss of data
2. **Given** website visitors accessing the site, **When** they browse content previously stored in JSON/MD files, **Then** they see identical information and experience

---

### User Story 3 - Enable Future Development (Priority: P3)

As a developer, I want to establish a proper content structure using Astro's recommended practices so that future content additions and modifications follow a consistent pattern.

**Why this priority**: This ensures sustainable development going forward and prevents the same issue from reoccurring.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding new content through the new collection system and verifying it works correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the new content collection system is in place, **When** I add new content items following the collection pattern, **Then** they properly integrate with the website
2. **Given** the new content system, **When** I reference content in Astro components, **Then** I get proper type checking and IDE support

### Edge Cases

- What happens when migrating content that contains special characters or complex formatting?
- How does the system handle content schemas that differ between JSON and MD files?
- What if some content files have inconsistent structure or missing required fields?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST define content collections for all existing content types previously stored in JSON and MD files
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide type-safe access to all content through the collection API
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing component references to content
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate content schemas when content is accessed through collections
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate proper TypeScript types for all content collections
- **FR-006**: Content from existing JSON files MUST be accessible via content collections without data loss
- **FR-007**: Content from existing MD files MUST be accessible via content collections without data loss
- **FR-008**: All existing pages MUST continue to display content correctly after migration
- **FR-009**: All content schemas MUST be defined to ensure consistency across content items

### Key Entities

- **ContentCollection**: Represents a group of related content items with a defined schema
- **JsonContentItem**: Content previously stored in JSON files, now managed through collections
- **MarkdownContentItem**: Content previously stored in MD files, now managed through collections

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: All existing JSON and MD content is accessible through Astro content collections (100% migration rate)
- **SC-002**: Build process completes successfully with no content-related errors after migration
- **SC-003**: All website pages load with identical content as before the migration (0% content loss)
- **SC-004**: Development team can add new content using content collections with improved type safety and IDE support
- **SC-005**: Content schemas prevent invalid content structure with automated validation (100% schema compliance)
